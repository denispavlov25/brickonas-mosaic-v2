# BRICKONAS Mosaic Configurator (v2)

A standalone web app that lets users turn any photo into a LEGO®-compatible brick mosaic, with live preview, color matching, and printable build instructions. Used in production at [brickonas.info/mosaik/](https://brickonas.info/mosaik/).

> **This is the v2 repository.** It is an independent, clean-history fork used for the BRICKONAS frontend rebuild. The original repo (`brickonas-mosaic`) is left untouched. Deep optimizations (vector PDF via jsPDF 2.x / pdf-lib, depth-map Web Worker) are planned here and tracked separately.

## Attribution

This project is a **derivative work** of [Lego Art Remix](https://github.com/debkbanerji/lego-art-remix) by [Deb Banerji](https://github.com/debkbanerji), originally published at [lego-art-remix.com](https://lego-art-remix.com/) under the [GNU GPL-3.0 license](LICENSE).

All credit for the original computer-vision algorithm, depth-map model integration (MiDaS via ONNX.js), color-matching logic, and PDF instruction generator goes to the original author.

**Forked / adapted:** February 2026.

## What's different from upstream

This fork adapts the original tool for the BRICKONAS brand and the German market:

- **German UI translations** (`js/i18n.js`) with `data-i18n` attributes throughout the interface
- **BRICKONAS branding** (logo, colors, header/footer styling)
- **Standalone deployment** as a self-contained static site (no build step), embedded in the WordPress site at `brickonas.info/mosaik/`
- **Minor UI/UX adjustments** for integration with the parent site's design system

The core algorithm, color science, depth-map worker, and instruction-generation logic are unchanged.
